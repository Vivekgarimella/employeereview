# employeereview
Over 67k employee reviews from 2008-2018 for six major companies namely: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft with variables: Location, Job-Title, Date Posted, Summary, Pros, Cons, and various ratings based on different personal and professional aspects of an employee are considered. This project answers a few of the most intriguing questions: “Which company is the best to work?” and “How overall rating of a company is being affected by different aspects of a company?” from an employee’s perception. R-studio is used to carry out this project.
